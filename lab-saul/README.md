## Description: Today i started by using map, filter, reduce, concat, and splice. These were envoked with apply and call. I wrote the basics of each required function, then wrote tests for each function and tested them. After that i worked on the CLI part of the lab and using both the code from class and some help from friends in the class i was able to figure out the required structure.
